These days I find myself holding back on code/design reviews, 
and I've been thinking about why. There seem to be more cons than pros:


Cons

- I've been bit by developers who take objective ly worded feedback super defensively
- Takes a lot of energy to explain, especially if someone is resistant 
- Is it too late to even matter? I.e. it would be too late to fix it anyway, so why bother raising
- Fear of retribution, like unfair treatment on your next review
- Potential for an unharmonious workplace

Pros

- More reliable, maintainable design benefits the business, keeps future changes 
easy, keeps developers sane
- Self-promotion: showing that I've done my homework
- Not internalizing thoughts/emotion, which is in general bad for mental health
