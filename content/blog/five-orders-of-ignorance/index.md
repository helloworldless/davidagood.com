title: The Five Orders of Ignorance

---

I came across this post recently. The Five Orders of 
Ignorance are essentially: 

- having the answer
- having a question
- unknown unknowns
- (software development) methodologies for revealing unknown unknowns
- not knowing about the Five Orders of 
Ignorance

There's another interesting point made in the post that 
the product of software engineering is not the code itself. 
Rather it's the knowledge contained in the code. This is interesting 
from a perspective of writing clean code. For example, you wouldn't 
write a book or technical guide without polishing it and refining it 
to make it easy to understand and follow, would you?
