I came across [this post](https://m-cacm.acm.org/magazines/2000/10/7556-the-five-orders-of-ignorance/fulltext) 
recently. The Five Orders of Ignorance are essentially: 

1. having the answer
1. having a question
1. unknown unknowns
1. (software development) methodologies for revealing unknown unknowns
1. not knowing about the Five Orders of Ignorance

There's another interesting point made in the post that 
the product of software engineering is not the code itself. 
Rather it's the knowledge contained in the code, or as the 
author puts it:

> Software is not a product, it's a medium for storing knowledge

This is interesting 
from the perspective of writing clean code. For example, you wouldn't 
write a book or technical guide without polishing it and refining it 
to make it easy to understand and follow, would you?

The article also talks about "hacking" (as in a hackathon, not exploitation) 
as a way of writing software while simultaneously transforming unknown unknowns 
into either questions or answers on how the system is supposed to function. 

The author doesn't explicitly state this, but in this sense 
hacking is a rudimentary form of software development 
methodology.

This also put me in mind of this line from Cracking The Coding Interviews:

> TODO (paraphrasing for now): Clarify the question and requirements with 
interviewer. After all, writing code before understanding the problem wastes 
company time and money.
