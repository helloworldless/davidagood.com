This is perhaps the most thorough (although horribly formatted) information on U.S. diplomatic license plates: **U.S. Department of State Office of Foreign Missions Diplomatic License Plates** (http://dcplates.com/OFM.htm).

Here is one of top sites containing a list of license plate prefix codes and the corresponding country or government body: **Codes Found on U.S. Issue Diplomatic and Consular Plates** (http://www.pl8s.com/diplo.htm). This is a good start, but I have encountered several diplomatic plates in the wild which are not on this list.

There is some information available in the U.S. Department of State's website: **Diplomatic Motor Vehicles Circular Notes and Notices** (https://www.state.gov/circular-notes-and-notices-diplomatic-motor-vehicles/).

Without further ado:
